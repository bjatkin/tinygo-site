We have a Tour of TinyGo, where you'll learn how to use TinyGo even if you aren't very familiar with programming hardware. You can find it [here]({{< ref "tour/blink/onboard.md" >}}).

The tour assumes you are already familiar with Go. If not, you can follow the [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/) to get started.
